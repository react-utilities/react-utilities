<!--
When trying to solve more solutions with Build Tracker, please keep in mind some of the following goals of the project:
* Be lightweight: small project size (single-digit KiBs, gzipped)
* Be easy: too many options in an API can become confusing
* Be clear: the intended purpose of every method should be as obvious as possible
* Is it easy to do this in "userland"? Would it be better off done there?

The goal of the project is to provide everyday components<br />
to speed up and simplify React development with little to no extra boilerplate code.

In this eco-system/monorepo, everyday React utilities can be implemented<br />
and tested so that users of this repository's utilities can use the <br />
provided utilities with confidence and without much thought.

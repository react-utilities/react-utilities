## Why 

There are several ways to approach building utilities for React. 

React Utilities focuses on simplicity. It has 1 dependency‚ÄîReact! It is a monorepo providing an echo system to quickly develop React utilities to be shared without the worry of code bloat because when it comes to installing your compmonent, your only importing a component and a little boilerplate from compilation. Furthermore, because tests are written for each component, you don't have to write tests. 

Basically, React Utilities aims to be the React code you code write but won't now that you can import a utility from this library without worry.

## Cites

Many if not all React Utilities are written very well elsewhere! React Utilities are meant to add both modern and classical solutions to everyday React development as well as recipes for common React development patterns so that you can focus on **your** app.

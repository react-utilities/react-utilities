React Utilities to speed up and simplify development 🏎

The goal of the project is to provide everyday compoments, in example window scroll detection, to speed up and simplify React development with little to no extra boilerplate code. In this eco-system/monorepo, everyday React utilies can be implemented and tested so that users can use them with confidence without thought.

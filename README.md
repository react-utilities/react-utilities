# React Utilities

React Utilities to speed up and simplify development üèé

The goal of the project is to provide everyday components, in example window scroll detection, to speed up and simplify React development with little to no extra boilerplate code. In this eco-system/monorepo, everyday React utilities can be implemented and tested so that users of this repository's utilities can use the provided utilities with confidence and without much thought.

## Why 🧐

There are several ways to approach building utilities for React.

### Simplicity

React Utilities focuses on **simplicity**. It has 1 dependency—React! It is a monorepo providing an echo system to quickly develop and test React utilities to be shared without the worry of code bloat because when it comes to installing your component, you're only importing **a component** and a little boilerplate from compilation.

### Tested

Furthermore, because tests are written for each component in React Utilities, you don't have to write tests. Basically, React Utilities aims to be the React code **you could write** but won't now that you can import a React Utility from this library without worry.

## Cites 🙏

Many if not all React Utilities are written **very well** elsewhere! React Utilities are meant to add solutions to everyday React development as well as recipes for common React development patterns so that you can focus on **your** app.

See **[React Use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use)**, **[React Fns](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/react-fns)**, **[The Platform](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/the-platform)**, and **[Jared Palmer](https://github.com/jaredpalmer)**'s work for a great start! 🏎💨
